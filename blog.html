                <p>Trevor explains how he used to enjoy attending the Black Church where he would watch pastors cast out demons from people as the possesed run up and down like mad men and sreaming in tongues,the persons had to fall feilure of which it meant
                    the demon was powerful and the pastor needed to be more hard so as to succeed in driving the demon away.</p>
                <p>Trevor pup's on a newspaper in the kitchen giving rain as an excuse and he wouldn't afford being rained on as he goes to the toilet and again the toilet's ironsheet were wore out and would leak on him ,He also talked of how their toilet
                    was full of flies and once one would bend down to do their business they would all fly towards his ass and this made him uncomfortable compared to how he enjoyed to pup in the kitchen with no distractions.He refered to the peaceful
                    environment as a state of relaxation and self-awareness</p>
                <p>Trevor requested for Eucharist and grape juice after a mass in his school and he was told that its only for the catholics and he failed to understand the reason behind it since Jesus is not a catholic.The next time before a mass he sneaks
                    to the altar and eats all the Eucharist and the juice there,he was taken to the Principal whom on canning him he laughed, reason being he was imagining of how he would have been enjoying if it would have been his mum canning him that

                    <p>Trevor's mom was always a free mother since she would go to the church in the morning ,spend her whole day moving from one church to the other since she would attend a service at White Church,Mixed Church and lastly at Black Church
                        the go back home in the evening but since she got into a relationship with Abel this stopped since he could not allow them spend the whole day at church claiming about what he would tell his friend that her wife has spent the whole
                        day at church</p>
                    <p>Trevor used to visit his dad oftenly mostly during the weekends,his birthday celebration and during Christmass but that was over when his step-dad came in since he wouldn't allow his mum go pay a visit to a man she gave birth with.

                    </p>
                    <p>Trevor's mom used to repair her car at any garage she felt like and they would also travel when they had the need to do so but when Abel married Trevor's mom he wasn't willing to repaire her car most especially when it broke down and
                        they were supposed to go to church and would not allow her to go repair it anywhere else claiming it was more than cheating and again they were no frequent travels and if they had to it was Abel to drive them.
